# SIY Frontend

> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

## Requirements

Below are listed the requirements to run this application.

- Node 12 or higher ([https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/))
- Yarn package manager ([https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/))

Some optional requirements for development, but recommended (as a VSCode extension):

- ESlint
- Prettier

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
